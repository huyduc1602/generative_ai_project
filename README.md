# Generative AI Project

This repository contains the implementation of a generative AI model.

## About

This generative AI project implements a state-of-the-art deep learning model capable of generating [specific type of content - text/images/audio/etc]. Built on [framework - PyTorch/TensorFlow/etc], it leverages recent advancements in [specific techniques - transformer architectures/GANs/etc] to produce high-quality outputs with minimal computational resources.

## Visualization
