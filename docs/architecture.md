# Architecture Documentation

This document describes the architecture of the generative AI model in this project.

## Overview

The generative AI project implements a transformer-based language model for text generation. The architecture follows modern best practices for developing, training, and deploying generative AI models.

## Components

### Data Processing

- **Data Loading**: The system supports loading data from various formats (CSV, JSON, TXT).
- **Preprocessing**: Text data is tokenized and prepared for model training.
- **Dataset Creation**: Custom PyTorch datasets manage the data during training and evaluation.

### Model Architecture

The model uses a transformer-based architecture, built on the foundation of models like GPT-2:

- **Transformer Blocks**: Self-attention mechanisms for capturing contextual relationships.
- **Autoregressive Generation**: The model generates text tokens sequentially, conditioning each token on previous tokens.
- **Configurable Architecture**: Model parameters like hidden size, number of layers, and attention heads can be configured.

### Training System

The training system includes:

- **Optimizer**: AdamW optimizer with configurable learning rate and weight decay.
- **Scheduler**: Linear learning rate scheduler with warmup.
- **Mixed Precision**: Option for mixed precision training to improve performance.
- **Checkpointing**: Regular model checkpointing to save progress and allow for training resumption.

### Evaluation

The evaluation system measures model performance using:

- **BLEU Score**: Measures n-gram precision between generated text and reference text.
- **ROUGE Scores**: Measures recall-oriented overlap between generated and reference text.
- **Custom Metrics**: Additional domain-specific metrics can be added as needed.

### Inference

The inference system provides:

- **Text Generation**: Generate text from given prompts.
- **Sampling Strategies**: Supports top-k, top-p (nucleus) sampling, and temperature adjustment.
- **API Service**: FastAPI-based service for model deployment.

## Workflow

1. Configure data, model, and training parameters in YAML configuration files.
2. Preprocess raw data into a format suitable for model training.
3. Train the model using the training script.
4. Evaluate model performance on test data.
5. Deploy the model for inference via command-line or API.

## Future Improvements

- **Distributed Training**: Add support for multi-GPU and multi-node training.
- **Advanced Architectures**: Incorporate newer transformer architectures.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Add RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) for improved outputs.
- **Quantization**: Model quantization for improved inference performance.
